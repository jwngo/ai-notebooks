# CNN Rescaling Identifier 
This was a project assigned during a Digital Image Processing module in Shanghai Jiaotong University.

The goal is to identify 4K images which have been upscaled from an image of a lower resolution, and 'true'/'real' 4K images.

A Convolutional Neural Network approach was used with inspiration from VGGNet
